The congruence theorem for const should conform to the following grammar:

thm := hyp1 /\ ... /\ hypn ==> (const x1 ... xn = const y1 ... yn)
hypi := (xi = yi) | !zi1 ... zimi. termi ==> (xi zi1 ... zimi = yi zi1 ... zimi)

Flexibility 1:
Any free variables (xi, yi, or a free variable in termi) may be universally
quantified at the top level.

Flexibility 2:
The conjuncts hyp1 ... hypn may appear in any order.

Limitation 1:
The lhs of the conclusion must match the form of any use of the constant in a
definition equation (or else termination conditions won't be extracted
correctly for that use).

Limitation 2:
When the lhs of the conclusion of hypi is applied to mi variables, then xi must
be an abstraction of at least (exactly?) mi variables in any use of the
constant ...

Limitation 3:
add_cong (and export_cong) will not check congruence rules for conformance.

Limitation 4:
add_cong (and export_cong) will not check that only one congruence rule is
supplied per constant.

Limitation 5:
Nested abstractions in the term to be defined must have distinct bound
variables. (Konrad is working on a bug fix for this.)
